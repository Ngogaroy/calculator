Fun Calculator
Welcome to the Fun Calculator! ðŸŽ‰ This is a simple Python program that lets you perform basic arithmetic operationsâ€”addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divisionâ€”on two numbers provided by the user. Whether you're a math whiz or just want to quickly crunch some numbers, this little calculator has got you covered!

Features
Takes two numbers as input (supports decimals!)

Calculates and displays:

Sum

Difference

Product

Quotient

How to Use
Run the script:

bash
python fun_calculator.py
Enter the first number when prompted (can be integer or decimal).

Enter the second number when prompted (can also be integer or decimal).

View the results for sum, difference, product, and quotient displayed on the screen.

Important Notes
The program assumes you will not divide by zero. Dividing by zero will cause an error. Please enter a non-zero second number to avoid this.

Input is handled using float() to support decimal numbers.

Example
text
Enter the first number: 10.5
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.5
Difference: 8.5
Product: 21.0
Quotient: 5.25
How it Works (Behind the Scenes)
The program asks for two numbers (num1 and num2).

It calculates:

sum_result = num1 + num2

difference_result = num1 - num2

product_result = num1 * num2

quotient_result = num1 / num2

Finally, it prints all the results with some fun emojis! ðŸ˜Ž

Future Improvements
Add error handling for division by zero.

Support more complex operations.

Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier use.

Allow repeated calculations without restarting the script.
